        <h3>About Echeveria</h3>
          <p>Echeveria is a large genus of flowering plants in the Crassulaceae family, native to semi-desert areas of Central America, Mexico and northwestern South America. </p>
          <p>Plants may be evergreen or deciduous. Flowers on short stalks (cymes) arise from compact rosettes of succulent fleshy, often brightly coloured leaves. Species are polycarpic, meaning that they may flower and set seed many times over the course of their lifetimes. Often numerous offsets are produced, and are commonly known as "hen and chicks", which can also refer to other genera, such as Sempervivum, that are significantly different from Echeveria.The genus is named after the 18th century Mexican botanical artist Atanasio Echeverr√≠a y Godoy.</p>
        <p>Many Echeveria species are popular as ornamental garden plants. They are drought-resistant, although they do better with regular deep watering and fertilizing. Most will tolerate shade and some frost, although hybrids tend to be less tolerant. Most lose their lower leaves in winter; as a result, after a few years, the plants lose their attractive, compact appearance and need to be re-rooted or propagated. In addition, if not removed, the shed leaves may decay, harboring fungus that can then infect the plant. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echeveria" class="source">(Wiki)</a></p>
        <h3>Urbinia purpusii</h2>
        <h4 class="header">Description</h3>
          <p>Echeveria purpusorum is a small slow growing plant, up to 3.1 inch (8 cm) tall, with succulent rosettes, up to 3.1 inch (8 cm) in diameter. The leaves are crowded, ovate, up to 1.6 inches (4 cm) long and up to 1 inch (2,5 cm) wide, deep olive-green, grey-green or white-green and mottled with irregular small redish-brown spots. The red-orange flowers sprout on a up to 8 inches (20 cm) long stem.</p>
        <h4 class="header">Care</h4>
          <p>Most of the common Echeveria species are not complicated succulents to grow, provided you follow a few basic rules. First, be careful never to let water sit in the rosette as it can cause rot or fungal diseases that will kill the plant. Additionally, remove dead leaves from the bottom of the plant as it grows. These dead leaves provide a haven for pests, and Echeveria are susceptible to mealy bugs. As with all succulents, careful watering habits and plenty of light will help ensure success.</p>
        <h4 class="header">Propagation</h5>
          <p>Most Echeveria can be easily propagated from leaf cuttings, although a few are better from seeds or stem cuttings. To propagate a leaf cutting, place the individual leaf in a succulent or cacti mix and cover the dish until the new plant sprouts. Repot as needed, preferably during the warm season. To repot a succulent, make sure the soil is dry before repotting, then gently remove the pot.  <a href="http://worldofsucculents.com/echeveria-purpusorum/" class="source">(source)</a></p>
