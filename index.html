    <h3>Urbinia purpusii</h2>
    <h4 class="header">Description</h3>
      <p>Echeveria purpusorum is a small slow growing plant, up to 3.1 inch (8 cm) tall, with succulent rosettes, up to 3.1 inch (8 cm) in diameter. The leaves are crowded, ovate, up to 1.6 inches (4 cm) long and up to 1 inch (2,5 cm) wide, deep olive-green, grey-green or white-green and mottled with irregular small redish-brown spots. The red-orange flowers sprout on a up to 8 inches (20 cm) long stem.</p>
    <h4 class="header">Care</h4>
      <p>Most of the common Echeveria species are not complicated succulents to grow, provided you follow a few basic rules. First, be careful never to let water sit in the rosette as it can cause rot or fungal diseases that will kill the plant. Additionally, remove dead leaves from the bottom of the plant as it grows. These dead leaves provide a haven for pests, and Echeveria are susceptible to mealy bugs. As with all succulents, careful watering habits and plenty of light will help ensure success.</p>
    <h4 class="header">Propagation</h5>
      <p>Most Echeveria can be easily propagated from leaf cuttings, although a few are better from seeds or stem cuttings. To propagate a leaf cutting, place the individual leaf in a succulent or cacti mix and cover the dish until the new plant sprouts. Repot as needed, preferably during the warm season. To repot a succulent, make sure the soil is dry before repotting, then gently remove the pot.</>
